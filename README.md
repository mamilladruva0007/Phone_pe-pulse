Data Processing: Preprocessed JSON / CSV data from PhonePe Pulse GitHub
📌 Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains extensive data related to digital payment transactions, user behavior, and regional metrics across India. While the data is rich, extracting actionable insights from raw and semi-structured files is challenging.
The objective of this project is to process the transformed PhonePe Pulse data and present it through a live, interactive geo-visualization dashboard that enables users to explore key metrics and trends intuitively. The dashboard must be secure, efficient, user-friendly, and capable of supporting data-driven decision-making.
